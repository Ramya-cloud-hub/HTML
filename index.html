        <h1>SELF YOGA FOR HEALTH</h1>
        <h5>While your gym or yoga studio may no longer be offering in-person yoga
            classes right now, you can still get in your fix at home: The best YouTube
            yoga videos can bring your favorite kind of classes right to your living room It's often 
            referred to simply as the Self. It's your true essence, and yoga teaches that this essence
             remains stable no matter what happens around you or to you, whether you feel connected with this part 
             of you or far removed from it</h5>

            <h3>Types of Yoga</h3>
            <h5>There are many types of yoga. Hatha (a combination of many styles) is one of the most 
                popular styles. It is a more physical type of yoga rather than a still, meditative form. 
                Hatha yoga focuses on pranayamas (breath-controlled exercises). These are followed by a series of
                asanas (yoga postures), which end with savasana (a resting period).
                The goal during yoga practice is to challenge yourself physically, but not to feel overwhelmed.
                At this "edge," the focus is on your breath while your mind is accepting and calm</h5>
           
            <h5>Yoga develops inner awareness. It focuses your attention on your body's abilities at the present moment.
                It helps develop breath and strength of mind and body. It's not about physical appearance.
                Yoga studios typically don't have mirrors. This is so people can focus their awareness inward
                rather than how a pose — or the people around them — looks. Surveys have found that those who practiced
                yoga were more aware of their bodies than people who didn't practice yoga. They were also more satisfied
                with and less critical of their bodies. For these reasons, yoga has become an integral 
                part in the treatment of eating disorders and programs that promote positive body image and self-esteem.</h5>
                
            <h5>Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at least four years,
                gained less weight during middle adulthood. People who were overweight actually lost weight. Overall,
                those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs) compared with those who did not practice yoga.
                Researchers attributed this to mindfulness. Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating.</h5>
               
            <h5>Another study found that practicing yoga improved lipid profiles in healthy patients as well as patients with known
                coronary artery disease. It also lowered excessive blood sugar levels in people with non-insulin dependent diabetes and reduced their need for medications.
                Yoga is now being included in many cardiac rehabilitation programs due to its cardiovascular and stress-relieving benefits.</h5>

            <h3>Exploring the therapeutic effects of yoga and its ability to increase quality of life</h3>
            <h5>Yoga is a form of mind-body fitness that involves a combination of muscular activity and an
                 internally directed mindful focus on awareness of the self, the breath, and energy.
                 [4] Four basic principles underlie the teachings and practices of yoga's healing system.
                 [6] The first principle is the human body is a holistic entity comprised of various interrelated
                 dimensions inseparable from one another and the health or illness of any one dimension affects the other dimensions.
                 The second principle is individuals and their needs are unique and therefore must be approached in a way that
                 acknowledges this individuality and their practice must be tailored accordingly. The third principle is yoga
                 is self-empowering; the student is his or her own healer. Yoga engages the student in the healing process; by playing
                 an active role in their journey toward health, the healing comes from within, instead of from an outside source and a
                 greater sense of autonomy is achieved. The fourth principle is that the quality and state of an individuals mind is crucial to healing. When the individual
                 has a positive mind-state healing happens more quickly, whereas if the mind-state is negative, healing may be prolonged.</h5>

                 <h5>Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia are among the most common reasons for
                      individuals to seek treatment with complementary therapies such as yoga.[18] Yoga encourages one to relax,
                       slow the breath and focus on the present, shifting the balance from the sympathetic nervous system and the 
                       flight-or-fight response to the parasympathetic system and the relaxation response.[5] The latter is calming and restorative; it lowers breathing and heart rate, 
                     decreases blood pressure, lowers cortisol levels, and increases blood flow to the intestines and vital organs</h5>
